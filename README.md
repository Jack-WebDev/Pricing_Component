## Overview

My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)
